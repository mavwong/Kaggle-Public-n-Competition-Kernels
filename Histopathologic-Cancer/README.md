# Histopathologic Cancer Detection

## Project Details
The project is to create an deep learning algorithm to identify or classify metastatic cancer taken from digital pathology scans. We classify them through series of convolutional neural network, fully connected network and pretrained network that helps with training and understanding problem. 

Initial model was written in the high level framework keras. Now, we use tensorflow 2.0 high level api which is also keras.

## Instructions
Run through each cell of the notebook. I suggest to run the notebook in kaggle which holds the data for the project.
