# Histopathologic Cancer Detection

## Project Details
The project is to create an deep learning algorithm to identify or classify metastatic cancer taken from digital pathology scans. We classify them through series of convolutional neural network, fully connected network and pretrained network that helps with training and understanding problem. 

The deep learning framework is written in Tensorflow 2.0.
