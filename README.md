# Kaggle Kernels
## 1. Project Details:
These projects are based on the topic deep learning. Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning where the networks of intelligence are being trained to predict, classify for obtaining optimal results. The networks of intelligence was inspired by our biological system called the human brain, where information processing or training is involved. Many of the educators today used this analogy. In the industry, this networks of intelligence are mainly called artificial intelligence or artificial neural network.

To train the network, *the neural network has to be given a data for training.* Kaggle has a huge library of data for the neural network to train on. Here are some data that was used to **train neural network.**
- [ ] MNIST (Reference Code)
- [ ] Dogs and Cats 
- [ ] Histopathologic Cancer
- [ ] Chest X-Ray


For now, I wanted to **update previous undocumented projects**, that where originally *written in the lower version of tensorflow and keras.* Further projects will be coming soon. Here are some mini-projects or competition that interests me ahead.

These projects is the authors way of fast implementing deep learning with the use of tensorflow 2.0. 

## 2. Getting Started:

### Prerequisite
A good understanding of artificial neural network will help you navigate throughout the documentation. In addition, python skillset must be at near intermediate for understanding the structure of the program. 

### Installation
In order to use this repository you must have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and deep learning framework for the project is tensorflow version 2.0. As recommended, you can do the projects in kaggle's kernel notebook since the data will be also provided by the site.

**Download or commit** the repository. You can find and access the data in kaggle. *Follow along the notebook and you can navigate through the end.* I suggest to **download the project and upload the notebook in kaggle.**
