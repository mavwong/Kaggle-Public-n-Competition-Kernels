# Dogs and Cats Classifier

## Project Details
The project is to create an deep learning algorithm to identify or classify the difference between dogs and cats. We classify them through series of convolutional neural network, fully connected network and pretrained network that helps with training and understanding problem. 

The deep learning framework is written in Tensorflow 2.0.

### Program Features (What's new to the author)
- Data Processing
- Tensorflow 2.0
- Transfer Learning
- Model Freezing
- Continuing the Models Progress through Fine-Tuning

## Instructions
Run through each cell of the notebook. I suggest to run the notebook in kaggle which holds the data for the project. Link Here.
