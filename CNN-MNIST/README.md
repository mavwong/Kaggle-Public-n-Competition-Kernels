# MNIST

## Project Details
The project is to create an deep learning algorithm to identify or classify handwritten digits. "The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems." 

## Instructions
Run through each cell of the notebook. I suggest to run the notebook in kaggle which holds the data for the project. Link Here.
